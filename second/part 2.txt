To prove LongerUPathD is NP-complete, we will show that UHPD â‰¤pLongerUPathD.
This will prove the claim, since UHPD is already known to be NP-complete.
Let G be a graph representing an  instance of UHPD. 
We transform G into G', another graph that will be an equivalent instance of LongerUPathD, as follows.
Let G consist of two copies of G, with no edges joining the two copies. 
(The nodes in G' will need to be renamed in some simple way, but we omit this detail.) 
Clearly, G' contains "yes" if and only if G contains a Hamilton cycle. So this transformation maps positive instances to positive instances and negative instances to negative instances, as required. 
In addition, the transformation can be achieved in linear time, which is certainly polynomial.
Hence the claim is proved.
